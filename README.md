# 🥏 DiscIt API

RESTful API for disc golf discs.

Enables developers to programmatically access public disc information from the amazing [Marshall Street Disc Golf Interactive Flight Guide](https://www.marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/flightguide) web page. Disc data is refreshed nightly via the [DiscIt API Refresh Service](https://github.com/cdleveille/discit-api-refresh).

Check it out live on fly.io! [discit-api.fly.dev](https://discit-api.fly.dev)

\* These fields use a URL-friendly **slug** string for search comparison. All non-alphanumeric characters are stripped out, and each space is replaced with a hyphen (e.g. `Crank SS` = `crank-ss`, `#1 Driver` = `1-driver`).

## Setup

-   Install [bun](https://bun.sh).
-   Install package dependencies: `bun i`
-   Create and populate a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file in the root directory.
    -   `API_KEY`: Secret key used to authenticate requests to the API. Can be any string value, but must match the value used in the [discit-api-refresh](https://github.com/cdleveille/discit-api-refresh) project.
    -   `MONGO_URI` (optional): Connection string to a MongoDB database. If not provided, a Docker container will need to be used instead to host the database locally.
-   If not using a custom MongoDB connection string, install and run [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Run `bun compose` to initialize the database container.
-   Run `bun dev` to start in watch mode (server restarts on file save).
-   Server will listen for requests on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
-   To populate the database with disc data, refer to the setup instructions for the [discit-api-refresh](https://github.com/cdleveille/discit-api-refresh) process.
